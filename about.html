            <h2>Baseball Player</h2>
            <p>
              I’ve always been passionate about baseball. From the moment I picked up a bat, I felt a sense of discipline and teamwork that resonated deeply with me. Playing baseball taught me the importance of perseverance, how to handle both wins and losses gracefully, and how working as a team can make the impossible possible. It’s a sport that teaches patience and strategy, and I carry those lessons with me in all aspects of my life, whether it's coding, studying, or personal growth.

            <h2>Music Lover</h2>
            <p>
              Music is my escape and a source of endless inspiration. I believe it’s one of the most powerful forms of expression, able to communicate emotions that words alone cannot. Whether it's relaxing to a soft melody or getting pumped up with a fast beat, music has a way of shaping my mood and clearing my mind. It also helps me connect with different cultures and experiences, making it a universal language I deeply appreciate.

            <h2>Love to Play Mobile Legends</h2>
            <p>
              Mobile Legends isn’t just a game; it’s an experience that challenges my strategic thinking and teamwork skills. I enjoy playing because it pushes me to think quickly, adapt to different situations, and work alongside teammates to achieve a common goal. It’s a great way to unwind, but it also teaches valuable lessons about leadership, communication, and overcoming challenges together with a team.
